🧩 UNIFIED PLATFORM FRONTEND - PROJECT PLANNING

🎯 PROJECT UNDERSTANDING & BUSINESS OVERVIEW

What is this project?
A unified frontend platform that serves as a centralized dashboard for users to access multiple applications through a single interface. Think of it as a "launchpad" where users can discover, request access to, and launch various business applications.

Core Business Problem Being Solved
• Fragmented Access: Users currently need to access multiple applications through different URLs, logins, and interfaces
• Access Control Complexity: Managing who has access to which applications is currently manual and inconsistent
• User Experience: No centralized place for users to discover available tools and manage their access

Business Value Proposition
• Single Sign-On Experience: Users authenticate once and access multiple applications
• Centralized Access Management: Admins can control user permissions from one place
• Improved User Discovery: Users can see all available applications and their access status
• Streamlined Onboarding: New users get a clear view of what's available to them

Target Users
• End Users: Employees who need access to various business applications
• Admins/Ops Team: Personnel who manage user accounts and application access

Overall User Flow

1. Authentication Flow
User visits platform → Login page → Choose authentication method:
├── Username/Password → Validate credentials
└── Microsoft OAuth → Redirect to Microsoft → Return with token
↓
Success → Redirect to Dashboard
Failure → Show error message

2. Dashboard Experience
User lands on Dashboard → See sidebar navigation:
├── Home: Welcome message, basic info
├── Launchpad: Grid of available applications
├── Notifications: System messages and updates
└── Profile: User settings and account management

3. Application Access Flow
User visits Launchpad → See app cards with different states:
├── ✅ Has Access → "Open App" button → Launch application
├── 🚫 No Access → "Request Access" button → Modal confirmation → API call → Toast notification
└── ⏳ Pending → "Access Requested" status

4. Admin Workflow
Admin needs to grant access → 
├── Create user accounts (no self-registration)
├── Assign application permissions
├── Share login credentials with users
└── Manage access requests from users

Key Business Rules
1. No Self-Registration: All user accounts are created by admins
2. Admin-Controlled Access: Users cannot gain access to applications without admin approval
3. Clear Permission Visibility: Users always know their access status for each application
4. Request-Based Access: Users can request access, but admins must approve
5. Unified Authentication: Single login provides access to the platform (individual apps may have their own auth)

Success Metrics
• User Adoption: How many users actively use the platform
• Access Request Volume: Number of access requests processed
• Time to Access: How quickly users can get access to needed applications
• User Satisfaction: Feedback on the unified experience

🛠️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Technology Stack

Component | Technology | Purpose
Framework | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | Modern React framework with SSR/SSG
Language | TypeScript | Type safety and developer experience
Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Utility-first CSS with pre-built components
State Management | React Context → Redux Toolkit | Progressive state management evolution
Authentication | NextAuth.js + Azure AD | Email/password + Microsoft OAuth
Design System | Custom Tailwind theme | Consistent design tokens and theming

Application Structure

Authentication Routes
• /auth/login - Username & Password login
• /auth/login/ms - Microsoft OAuth login
